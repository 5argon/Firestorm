All rights reserved.

Here is a list of license attribution that Native Audio uses. You have to do your part and abide to the rule as well as a part of the free software movement.

SRC (Secret Rabbit Code) by Erik de Castro Lopo is a resampler code that Native Audio uses in Android part when it encounter a device with native sampling rate other than 44100Hz. We agreed on using only 44100Hz audio and therefore the "fast path" player that will be made to fit the native sampling rate of your player's device need a compatible audio.

The license is 2-clause BSD which is really permissive and requires you only to put the attribution below in the game. (You are doing 2nd clause, and this file you are reading is me doing the 1st clause of the BSD license.)

The credit screen in your game would be perfect for this.
Native Audio being a paid product does not require any attributions but is welcomed if you would like to do so.
